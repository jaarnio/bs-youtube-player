## Instructions

Populate the "playlist.js" file with the URLS of the Youtube videos you would like to play as your playlist. Make sure the URLs follow the syntax seen in the file (quotes and comma separated).

Attach the "index.html" as a Local Site to the HTML Widget in BA:con.

Publish.

## Known Issues

Needs better error handling to catch videos that are not allowed to be embedded.
It should skip over them after 5 retries, but might also freeze the video.

## Future

Add UDP listeners to advance / reverse playlist.
Add Shuffle feature
Make code less crappy
